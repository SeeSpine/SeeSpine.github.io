        <p>If you are still growing: <br>a) Curves less than 20°: observation via X-rays every 6 months.<br>b) Curves between 20° to 50°: continued X-ray monitoring and a back brace-- different
          types of braces are available depending on the individual curve pattern.<br>c) Curves greater than 50°: surgery is indicated.<br><br>If you are finished growing:<br>a) Curves less than 50°: no treatment.<br>b) Curves greater than 50°: surgery.<br>For more information on scoliosis treatment, click <a href = "https://www.srs.org/patients-and-families/conditions-and-treatments/adolescents/treating-scoliosis"> here. </a></p>

      <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Why should we care about X-rays in scoliosis?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Repeated radiation exposure can lead to health risks such as cancer and other illnesses.
          Although X-rays are often necessary for various medical reasons, it is important to avoid
          repetitive X-rays whenever possible.<br><br>Scoliosis patients are subject to many X-rays, leading to an increased risk of breast and
          other cancers. For this reason, SeeSpine delivers a radiation-free alternative to minimize
          risk in scoliosis monitoring.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How much does scoliosis surgery cost?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>In the United States, the average cost of surgery is $150,000 USD. In Canada, the
          minimum cost to the healthcare system is $60,000 CAD (similar for other public
          healthcare systems).</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">What is discontinuous follow-up and why is it bad?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Scoliosis patients typically receive C-rays every 6 months to check for curve progression.
          Since curves worsen during growth and growth spurts can occur rapidly, patients
          frequently deteriorate quickly between visits.<br><br>By tracking patients monthly, SeeSpine detects growth spurts and curve progression to
          initiate preventative treatments earlier.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How could SeeSpine know what my spine looks like without actually seeing it?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>SeeSpine employs artificial intelligence to quantify surface topography (what we can see
          from the outside) to predict the shape of the spine (what we need X-rays to see)!</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>That’s it! Your physician will automatically be notified of your results and follow-up
          regarding next steps. Look out for instructions from your physician and/or the SeeSpine
          application!</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How do I know if my brace is working properly?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The purpose of a back brace is to stop your curve from getting worse. If your monthly
          SeeSpine scans are stable, we know the brace is working! On the other hand, if you are
          wearing a brace but your curve continues to progress, we know the brace is ineffective!</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">My brace hurts. What should I do?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It is normal for a brace to cause discomfort, especially for the first few weeks of use.
          More severe pain is typically a sign that the brace does not fit properly. In this case, the
          brace should be altered or replaced. It is important to note that as your child grows,
          they may periodically require a new, larger brace.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">I have back pain. What should I do?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Scoliosis patients are allowed to experience back pain just like anyone else! Back pain is
          not a sign that your curve has gotten worse and should not cause you to worry. <br><br>
          For light or modest pain, we suggest:<br>
          a) Physical activity, particularly strengthening abdominal muscles (swimming, yoga,
          sports, etc.)<br>
          b) Changing positions frequently<br>
          c) Avoiding painful positions and activities<br><br>
          If your back pain is too severe or does not improve after two months of increased
          physical activity, we encourage you to contact your physician.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The more you wear the brace, the more effective they are! <br>
          If you forget to wear your brace or need to remove it for whatever reason, simply
          resume wearing it as soon as possible. If your brace wear is paused for an extended
          period without your physician’s approval, we suggest performing a SeeSpine scan
          immediately.</p>
